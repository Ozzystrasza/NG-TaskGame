      if not mended. Steel\u2019s honest work. It bends, it breaks, and you fix it.
      People\u2026 not so simple. If you\u2019re heading beyond the ridge, let me
      reinforce your gear. No charge if you bring back good news\u2026 or at least
      come back breathing."

      only slightly watered\u2014on my honor. Travelers bring coin, but they also
      bring tales, and I value those just as much. Stay a while and share what you\u2019ve
      seen on the road. Around here, stories travel faster than horses\u2026 and
      sometimes they arrive first."

      letter to the reeve before sunset, but the path by the old shrine gives me
      the shivers. They say the bells ring on their own when no one\u2019s near.
      You look brave, though. If you\u2019re going that way\u2026 maybe we could
      walk together? Just until the bridge, at least."
